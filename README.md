# Embedded Linux and Security Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey to mastering **Embedded Linux** and **Security** over the course of one year. Every day, I will share a new topic along with practical examples, hands-on exercises, and insights from the field.

## Objective

To become an expert in Embedded Linux and Security by learning new concepts and applying them in real-world scenarios. Topics range from system architecture, bootloaders, kernel development, and security to advanced topics such as device tree configuration, memory management, and secure boot.
